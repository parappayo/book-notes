# About

* [Resilient Management](https://resilient-management.com/)
* by Lara Hogan
* published by A Book Apart, 2019

# Take-Aways

* Optimize for balance, not perfection
* This book covers human growth and resiliency, not management strategy or product delivery
* Having devs stay with the same manager even as they switch teams is hard on the manager; having devs switch managers when they switch teams is hard on the devs
* Know your team, help them to know you; work at self-awareness, try to categorize your management approaches
* Managers emphasize different values: transparency, collaboration, strategy; articulate your values to your team; where are you trying to improve? what can you be relied upon for? what BICEPS value matters most?
* What are you optimizing for? deliver faster? improve user experience? improving team autonomy?
* Too many options or too few can be threatening
* Storming involves friction; the org will go through periods of change, team members need to adapt
* Some people are not interested in growth, can become actively harmful; a change of venue can help, but do not pass on a problem
* Team members may come to you with feedback on others, you may need to coach them to deliver that feedback themselves; help them make a communication plan; delivering another person's feedback is difficult, but sometimes a moderator is needed
* Common sexism trap: when women are collaborative, they are perceived as incompetent, but when they emphasize their competence, they are seen as cold and unlikable

# Concepts

* 1-on-1 - aka 1:1; topics include what makes you grumpy, how you express grumpiness, feedback preferences (media / channel), goals, support needed, reward preferences; goals include building trust (demonstrating investment), building shared context, planning career growth (opportunities, feedback), solve problems
* Amygdala - fight or flight response part of the brain
* BICEPS - belonging, involvement / process, choice, equality / fairness, predictability, significance; different people have different BICEPS priorities and values
* Center for Talent Innovation, The - studies the benefits of sponsorship, it is huge
* Closed Questions - typically can only be answered "yes" or "no"
* Coaching - asking open questions, encouraging reflection; often does not feel as productive as mentoring, but is better for fostering growth; mirroring back what you've heard to solidify understanding helps reflection
* Core Needs - prerequisites to feel safe and secure; BICEPS acronym
* Discipline - your character class; your primary skill set
* Feature Team - when team members work on a specific product or feature; typically cross-functional
* Feedback - giving praise, pointing out problems (improvement opportunities), making sure the team aligns to goals; tie this to job description language where possible; make it specific, actionable, measurable; it must be understood by the recipient
* Feedback Equation - observation of behaviour + impact of behaviour + request or question = specific, actionable feedback; usual caveats apply: keep observations factual, make it about the behaviour and not the person, avoid triggering an amygdala hijack, try to coach rather than mentor; impact may be a few levels removed, requires following up with "and what was the impact of that?"; doing this frequently with small issues is best; good question might be "what are you optimizing for" or "help me to understand"
* Forming - first stage of team development; team is coming together
* Functional Team - when team members are of the same discipline
* In-Group Bias - people tend to be most comfortable sponsoring others who they are most similar to
* Introspection - hard work; encourage this in others to help them grow
* Learning - four factors are novel challenge, low ego, space to reflect / brainstorm, quality feedback (timely, unambiguous)
* Low Ego - humility is ideal for learning; ego gets in the way of new information
* Mad Lib - somewhat mis-used in this book to mean "fill in the blanks" (but not at random)
* Management Matrix - manager's reports can be spread across teams
* Manager Roles - course correct the team through Mentoring, Coaching, Sponsoring, Delivering Feedback; choose the right balance for the situation
* Mentoring - lending advice, helping to solve problems; managers often spend the most time in this mode; be careful how this is applied to underrepresented people, be open
* Norming - third stage of team development; conventions are being reached
* Open Questions - typically start with who, what, where, when, why, or how; the best questions are about the problem, not the solution; be genuinely curious, avoid being judgemental
* Performance Improvement Plan - HR will typically require this to be tried before an employee can be fired
* Performing - fourth stage of team development; flow state; team is motivated, disagreements are productive
* Prefrontal Cortex - rational part of the brain
* Sponsoring - finding opportunities for team members; often happens while the person being sponsored is not present; take responsibility for helping your team members advance; underrepresented people are typically over-mentored and under-sponsored
* Storming - second stage of team development; early friction
* Teammates - your reports; people you can hire, fire, raise, etc.
* Trust - primary measure of a team's overall health; manager's job is to foster it
* Tuckman's Stages of Group Development - Forming, Storming, Norming, Performing; creation of or changes to a team often kick off this cycle anew
